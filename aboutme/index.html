    <p>       I currently work at Walmart in the electronics department and
        I enjoy learning more about tech and helping people solve thier tech
        Issues.  I also enjoy seeing the latest toys right when they come
        out.  I was born and raised working construction in my fathers company
        in California but recently moved to Utah with my wife to buy a house,
        focus on school and start a family. I am currently working
        towards a degree in software engineering and focusing on my 
        cybersecurity certificates.  I like to play video games when I have 
        the time as well as work on my trucks.
