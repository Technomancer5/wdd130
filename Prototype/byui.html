        <!--Again, we are using an attribute value for the src property that 
            is taking us to an image that is located externally to our site. 
            Normally you would want to use an internal path to your own images 
            folder where your website images are located. Something like 
            src="images/map-banner.jpg" This would assume that you have a folder 
            called images with a jpg image called 'map-banner.jpg' located in 
            that images folder of your site. But for ease of this prepare 
            practice we will use the external image. -->
